# This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game board is made up of a 3x3 grid, and each cell is a clickable box where either an X or an O can be placed. The player who places three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

The game keeps track of whose turn it is, and the player's name is displayed on the screen. The names are stored in local storage, which means that they will persist even after the player closes the browser.

The code uses basic JavaScript logic to check if a player has won the game. The game ends when one of the players wins, or if all the cells are filled and no player has won (in which case it's a draw).

To play the game, simply click on a box to place your mark. The game will automatically switch turns between X and O. To restart the game, simply refresh the page.

Note: This is a very basic implementation of Tic Tac Toe and does not include features such as error handling or multiplayer functionality.
